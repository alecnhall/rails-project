How do I want to start this project?

I think the first thin that I want to start with is the user model because I know I need this and it may be the hardest model to set up.

What do I need to set up a user model?

`rails g resource user username:string email:string password_digest:string --no-test-framework`

controller actions

-log in 
-new
-create 
-show 
    - has_one :pantry 
        - pantry 
            - has_many :items 
            - belongs_to :user 
        - items
            - belongs_to :pantry 
    - creates recipe 
        - recipe
            - has_many :ingredients 
            - ingredients 
                - quantity 
                - name 


welcome controller w/ a home page 
sessions controller

So far I have created my welcome page and made sure that it is rendering in my layout. I have added links to my welcome page that give the user the option to sign in but they are undefined at this point so the view is not rendering.
