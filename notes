How do I want to start this project?

I think the first thin that I want to start with is the user model because I know I need this and it may be the hardest model to set up.

What do I need to set up a user model?

`rails g resource user username:string email:string password_digest:string --no-test-framework`

user model
- validates uniqueness and presence of email, username
- has_secure_password
- validates email format and downcases all emails entered
- has_one :pantry

users controller actions

-index 
    - render 'login'
-new
    - instantiates new user instance for form_for 
-create 
    - if user is not created redirects to new user page
    - if created it goes to user show page 
-show 
    - pantry 
        - has_many :items 
        - belongs_to :user 
    - items
        - belongs_to :pantry 
        - name
        - quantity
    - creates recipe 
        - recipe
            - has_many :ingredients 
            - ingredients 
                - quantity 
                - name 


welcome controller w/ a home page 

home 
sessions controller
- create
    - find user 
        - if it finds the user and authenticates the password 
            - add user id to session
            - redirect_to user_url(@user)
        - redirect if user not found to login page

- destroy
    - removes :user_id from session 

So far I have created my welcome page and made sure that it is rendering in my layout. I have added links to my welcome page that give the user the option to sign in but they are undefined at this point so the view is not rendering.
